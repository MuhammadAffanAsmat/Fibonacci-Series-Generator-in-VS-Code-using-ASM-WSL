# Fibonacci-Series-Generator-in-VS-Code-using-ASM-WSL

1. Introduction to project
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the previous two numbers, beginning with 0 and 1. It is commonly utilized in computer science and mathematics for the representation of recursion, iteration, and algorithmic reasoning.
2. Project aim and Objective
This project involves creating a Fibonacci Series Generator using Assembly Language (NASM) on a Linux platform (Ubuntu through WSL). The software accepts user input to identify the number of terms of the series to be generated and prints the series through system calls and low-level register manipulation. The project will be developed and run using VS Code with Ubuntu (WSL), demonstrating how low-level programming directly interfaces with system hardware as well as the operating system.

This project serves as an excellent exercise in:
•Practicing loop structures and conditional logic in assembly
•Performing integer arithmetic conversion manually
•Understanding how systems call work in Linux
•Handling user input and output at a low level
